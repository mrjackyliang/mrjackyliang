Coding Conventions
===================

Welcome to the __Coding Conventions__ section of my GitHub profile repository!

Within this directory, you'll find a comprehensive guide to the evolving set of conventions and philosophies that govern how I write code. As my understanding and preferences evolve, so too will these conventions.

The contents below outline an evergreen list of the current state of my coding practices and philosophies.
